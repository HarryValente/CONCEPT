Homeware website 


This homeware website was created for my uni degree and was meant to be a linear website as the teacher didn't want to see multiple product pages with the same design. He wanted to see that we could do it once and in turn show us a range of skills in the process.

Therefore the progression through the website is as follows ---

Homepage  ----> Kitchenware -----> Kettle product

On these pages there is different things to play around with like a search bar on the kitchenware page, descriptions and adding to basket on the kettle page.

My uni course only asked for static web pages and didn't ask for responsive websites however multi screen websites aren't only the future but they are the present and have been for a while therefore to push myself I learned how to create responsive website with this as my first outcome.

Over the process I learned alot about CSS as this project was quite CSS heavy as it doesn't include any API work or any OOP. It was my first project using grid and flexbox and wow that made things alot easier. The search feature searches through things on the page and was easier than I thought (I was expecting this to be super hard) it just loops through each letter and matches products with the same letters. The add to cart feature takes the value entered and just places it in the cart and uses template literals to grab the data from one place into another.

I also explored using different libraries e.g on the homepage I tried out animate on scroll which is a JS library which allows things to well animate on scroll, this made that part of the website super easy as it took very little code and opened my eyes to libraries. However since then I have decided to try out hand-coding something similar and the evidence of this is on the seaPLANit website on my portfolio site.
